	'The Road Ahead',
	'The road ahead might be paved - it might not be.',
	'Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recentwind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, inthe fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless,without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hintin it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as thesmile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It wasthe masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort oflife. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.<br><br>
  	But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfishdogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths,spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystalsof frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which draggedalong behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface restedon the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and underthe bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long andnarrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot andfrying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.<br><br>
  	In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a second man. Onthe sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the Wild had conquered and beatendown until he would never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Lifeis an offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes thewater to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to theirmighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submissionman—man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must inthe end come to the cessation of movement.<br><br>
  	But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet dead. Their bodieswere covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with thecrystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. This gave them the seeming ofghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all theywere men, penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossaladventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as theabysses of space.<br><br>',
